**Input**
      1 or more :ref:`Interaction <compound_interaction>` :ref:`Sets <compound_set>`
**Output**
      :ref:`Interaction <compound_interaction>` :ref:`Sets <compound_set>`

This operation takes the union of :ref:`Interactions <compound_interaction>` in a :ref:`Set <compound_set>`, yielding one :ref:`Set <compound_set>` made up of each of the input interactions. Each Interaction in the output set preserves its attributes. The union of one interaction set is the set itself.
